                    The Founder and CEO Dennis Niño Alog grew up in a small village in Muntinlupa City, one of the key cities of the National Capital Region in the Philippines. At the time young Dennis’ adventurous nature led him to explore his community into the vacant lots full of tall grasses, water catching plants and areas that have potholes of stagnant water, old tires and junk stuffs. Unknowingly to him, mosquitoes bred on these undeveloped and unsanitary places.

                <p>Dennis caught his first dengue fever at the age of 9 that led him hospitalized for two weeks. Three years later, he contracted again another strain of dengue virus but this time with a typhoid fever brought by eating street cart foods that passed by every afternoon in front of their house. He was hospitalized for almost a month because of these two culprit diseases. And a year after, his eldest sister got Dengue that almost made her not to graduate from high school.
