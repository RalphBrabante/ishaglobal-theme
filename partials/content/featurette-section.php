                        diseases in the world.</p>

                    <p>In the Philippines, the Department of Health reported over 146,000 cases of dengue fever in
                        2019, resulting in 622 deaths and prompting the agency to declare it a “national epidemic”.
                        Filipinos are no stranger to the struggle against dengue, and in a country constantly battered

                    <p>IGDC now offers disinfection and sanitizing services, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The
                        pandemic put a spotlight on the importance of properly sanitized spaces, equipment and personnel
